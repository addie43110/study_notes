# Requirements Engineering
  - identify purpose of software in context of human activities
  - human-computer interaction
  - may be that identifying the problem is a problem in itself (wicked problem)

Ideally, we want to separate the problem from the solutions

# RE Processes
  - elicitation
  - analysis
  - specification
  - validation and verification
  - negotiation
  - management

## Elicitation
  1. what information should be gathered?
  2. from what sources can it be gathered?
  3. by what mechanisms / techniques it may be gathered?

## Analysis
  - study and understand the problem domain

## Specification
  - define the behaviour of the system

## Validation & Verification
  - validation: "are we building the right product?"
  - verification: "are we building the product right?"

## Negotiation
  - ensure expectations are consistent for both sides

## Management
  - adhere to the requirements

# Problems with requirements
  - difficult to communicate clearly
  - difficult to document
  - difficult to negotiate
  - difficult to manage (change)

# Time management
Parkinson's law: the work allocated to a task fills the time allocated to it
