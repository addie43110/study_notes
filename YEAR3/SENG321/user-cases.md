# Use cases
  - ways in which the system is being used
  - expresses functional requirements
  - written using simple prose -> easy to understand

## Use case elements
  - title
  - summary
  - actors
  - preconditions
  - description
  - exceptions
  - postconditions

## Writing use cases
  - think of each actor and how they use the system
  - make up specific scenarios for each use case
  - determine interaction sequence
  - write it down!
  - consider exceptions and alternate paths

## Use case model vs use case diagrams
  - use case model includes ALL use cases
  - use case diagram for one use case

## Actors
  - not all users are actors
  - actors may not be human (can be systems)
  
## Main flow
  - always starts with actor's action
  - response from system and actor dialogue

## "Include" relationship
  - functionality that is repeated in more than 2 use cases can be factored out into a separate use case
  - use syntax: "include [use case name]
  - the included use case is a standalone usecase, complete with its own alternative flows, if applicable
