# Software Quality: non-functional vs functional requirements

## Functional vs non-functional requirements
  - functional requirements describe fundamental functions of the system
  - non-functional requirements describe
    - constraints on the system (reliability, portability, safety, performance, ...)
    - contraints from the application domain

## List of NFRs
  - reliability
  - efficiency
  - integrity
  - usability
  - maintainability
  - flexibility
  - portability
  - reusability
  - interoperability

# Quality attribute scenario
  - quality
  - attribute
  - stimulus
  - response
  - response measure

ie. "Maintability: when a new feature is added, the new feature is deployed in < 4 hours"


## Why QAS?
  - measurable => objective
  - test design / implementation
  - acceptance criteria: I won't sign off on the payroll system until you meet the accuracy requirement


# Software maintainability
  - related to software complexity
  - main cost in most installations
  - technical factors
    - coupling
    - programming language
    - validation + testing
    - quality / quantity of software documentation

# Software reliability
  - probability of failure on demand: the measurement of how likely it is for software to fail given some input
  - rate of fault occurrence
  - mean time to failure
  - availability
    - A = Tup / (Tup + Tdown)
