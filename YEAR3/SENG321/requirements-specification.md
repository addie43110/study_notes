# Requirements Specification
  - communicate understanding of requirements
  - often used as a contract
  - baseline for change control

# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) contents
  - functionality
  - external interfaces (user, hardware, software, communication)
  - performance
  - design constraints
  - other requirements

# Functional requirements
  - inputs => outputs
  - user interface (UI) structure and behavious
  - data processing
  - error handling

# Non-functional requirements
Think of constraints!
  - physical environment
  - user / human factors
  - documentation
  - resources
  - quality assurance
  - security
  - system interfaces

# SRS must be...
  - unambiguous
  - complete
  - verifiable
    - a process exists to test specification of each requirement
  - consistent
    - same terms used for same object
    - characteristics of objects remain consistent
    - no typos / opposing sentences
      - ie. "A follows B" in one part and "A and B occur simultaneously" in another
  - modifiable
    - easy to use organization, easy to change without difficulty
  - traceable
    - origin of each requirement is clear ('backward traceability'
    - facilitates referencing future documentation related to RS ('forward traceability') such as test plans, design spec, ...
  - ranked for importance
  - correct
    - contains as much that is needed and no more
