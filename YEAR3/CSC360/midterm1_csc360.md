3. Memory
4. I/O
5. Different architectures

### Computer organization
TODO: Add diagram

### 2. CPU (Central Processing Unit)
  - made up of:
    - ALU (Arithmetic + Logic Unit)
    - PC (program counter)
    - level 1 cache
    - registers
    - clock
    - FPU (floating point unit)

### 3. Memory
* Note that network storage is difficult to compare right now. It is normally slower, but in the future, it could easily be faster than a CD.

### 4. Input/Output
#### 4.1 Access
  - need to give address (port #, what interrupt, pin numbers)
  - need to know if we're using interrupts or DMA (direct memory access)

#### 4.2 Synchronous vs asynchronous
