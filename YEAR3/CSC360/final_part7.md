# Memory Management and Virtual Memory

## Logical vs Physical Addresses
**Logical Address**

An address generated by the CPU is referred to as a logical address (also known as a _virtual address_). 

**Physical Address**

An address seen by the main memory unit is known as a physical address.

**What the textbook says**

If address-binding is done at compile-time or load-time, logical and physical addresses are identical. However, execution-time address-binding results in different logial and physical addresses.

## Paging
In order to get into paging, we must talk about segmentation.

### Segmentation
Programmers think about their programs as a bunch of segments existing somewhere in memory space.

Each segment has a name and a length. Thus, a logical address consists of a two tuple:

<p align="center"> \<segment-number, offset\> </p>

### Back to paging...
Segmenetation allows the physical address space of a program to be non-contiguous. The basic method for paging involves breaking physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called framges. Similarly, we break the logical memory into blocks of the same size called pages.

When a process is to be executed,
  - its pages are loaded into any available memory frames form their source (ie. file system or disk)

Every logical address is divided into two parts:
  1. a page number
  2. a page offset

The **page number** is used as in index for the **page table**. For example, a page number of 3 would correspond to entry 3 of the page table, or `page_table[3] = f` where f is the corresponding frame.
