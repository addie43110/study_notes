# Interaction Design in Practice

- interaction designers face pressures
  - time, resources
  - need to work with stakeholders + other roles
- synonyms: interface designer, information architect, experience design, UX designer

## Leveraging
- UX designers do not start from scratch
  - reuse existing designs and concepts
  - use design patterns
  - make reusable components
  - make use of prototyping and testing tools

## Agile
- agile became popular during the 2000s
- agile starts as soon as possible with a minimal set of requirements
- user research: data collection and analysis in shorter time frames (sprint, timebox, cycle)
- lean UX
- minimum viable product is a key concept

Big design upfront (BDUF) is anathema to agile working.
