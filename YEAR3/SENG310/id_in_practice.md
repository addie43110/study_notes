# Interaction Design in Practice

- interaction designers face pressures
  - time, resources
  - need to work with stakeholders + other roles
- synonyms: interface designer, information architect, experience design, UX designer

## Leveraging
- UX designers do not start from scratch
  - reuse existing designs and concepts
  - use design patterns
  - make reusable components
  - make use of prototyping and testing tools

## Agile
- agile became popular during the 2000s
- agile starts as soon as possible with a minimal set of requirements
- user research: data collection and analysis in shorter time frames (sprint, timebox, cycle)
- lean UX
- minimum viable product is a key concept
- Big design upfront (BDUF) is anathema to agile working.
- to co-locate or not to co-locate

## Documentation
- capture and communicate design through documentation
  - user research results
  - personas
  - detailed interface sketches
- agile: minimal documentation, focus on design and working product
- slack vs. email

## Design patterns
- proposed by Christopher Alexander
- ex. inner courtyard
- describes a problem, solution, and where this solution has been found to work

### Model-view-control
- originally introduced in SmallTalk
