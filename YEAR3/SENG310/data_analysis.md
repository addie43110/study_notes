# Data analysis, interpretation, and presentation

- quantitative and qualitative data analysis
- analyze data gathered from questionnaires
- data from intrviews
- data from observational studies
- common pitals in data analysis
- presenting data

## Process of data analysis
- initial reactions / observations from the data
- statistics are calculated and patterns are identified
- interpretation proceeds in tadem with analysis
- common mistake is for belief/biases to influence your interpretation

### Example
- consider customer inquiries routed through Sydney take longer than the ones routed form Moscow
- is it customer care operatives?
- is it customers?
- follow up data and triangulation can help figure out what's going on
- simple rule of thumb: for any hypothesis, be willing to accept all possible answers as true

## Qualitative vs Quantitative
- qualitative: descriptions, quotes, video recordings, images
- quantitative: numbers, or can easily be translated into numbers

## Statistics
- averages, percentages, mean, median, mode
- important to consider other metrics
  - diversity treated as noise
  - identifying outliers

## Qualitative analysis
- overall first impression
- begin looking for patterns
- any first impressions should be confirmed and refined with more rigorous analysis
- affinity diagram: paper notes placed on a board, related notes placed near other related notes to form clusters
- categorization: ex. student seating patterns

## Think-aloud sessions using categorization scheme
- researcher writes down what is said during a think-aloud session and organizes it by category

## Critical incidents
- identify critical requirements of good and bad performance by pilots
- get HARD FACTS instead of opinions and ratings
- facts should be able behaviours with significantly contribute to the activity

## Tools for data analysis
- spreadshets
- video / audio annotation software
- satistical analysis software (MATLAB, Python, SPSS)

## Using theoretical frameworks
- grounded theory
- distributed cognition
- activity theory

### Grounded theory
- approach to qualitative data
- develop theory from systematic analysis and interpretation of empirical data
- ie. theory is grounded in data
- bottom-up approach to try to reduce researcher bias
- iterative: data collected, categories identified, data recollected, repeat.

Three aspects:
- open coding (categories, properties and dimensions identified)
- axial coding - relating categories hierarchically
- selective coding - refining and integrating categories to form a larger theory


In simple terms: "Grounded theory involved the collection and analysis of data. The theory is "grounded" in actual data, which mean the analysis and development of theories happens after you have collected the data."

### Example
"Hi there, I am Henry. I just wanted to say hello and provide you with the rest of our group member's email addresses... Well, I guess we'll see each other on Sunday at the video conference."

Sample codes and notes:
1. Leadership - initiative to represent
2. Establishing team's co-presence on the internet
3. Implying preference for communication technology (email)

Theory of how virtual teams develop over time - for example stages.

## Distributed cognition
- event driven description
- granularity of analysis is important
- better understanding of work domain that is being studied
- learn trade under study

For example, consider a medical surgery team and implications for the design of an ICU (intensive care unit).
  - significant distribution of cognition
  - work practices - communication patterns, not a single way

Terminology:
- cognitive system: the interactions among people; the artifacts they use, and the environment they are working in
- communicative pathways: the channels by which information is passed between people
- propagation of representational states: how information is transformed across different media. Media consists of external artifacts and internal representations.

Simple: "Distributed cognition is the theory that knowledge lies not only within the individual, but in the individual's social and physical environment."

"Distributed cognition is a branch of cognitive science that proposes cognition and knowledge are not confined to an individual; rather, it is distributed across objects, individuals, artifacts, and tools in the environment."

## Activity theory

Simple: "Active theory is a framework or descriptive tool for a system. People are socio-culturally embedded actors (not processors or system components). There exists a hierarchical analysis of motived human action (levels of activity analysis).

- a product of soviet psychology
- explains human behavior in terms of our practical activity with the world

## Presenting findings
- rigorous notation, diagrams
- using sories, scenarios
- summarizing findings
- depends on stakeholder(s)
