# Identifying needs and establishing requirements

## Aims
- identify needs
- produce stable set of requirements
- gather data
- analyze data
- iterate
- requirements gathering: stage where most failures begin

## Estalblishing requirements
- what do users want?
- what do users need?
- requirements need clarification, refinement, completion, and re-scoping
- input: requirements document (maybe)
output: set of requirements
- why establish?
  - understand user needs
  - justified and relates back to data collected

## What is a requirement?
- statement about intended product that specifies what it should do and how it should perform
- specific, unambiguous, clear
  - ex. time to download any page is less than 5 seconds on a DSL line of 20 Mbits/second
  - the playback bar should always indicate the position in the audio stream
- too vague example: appeals to teenage girls
  - buttons should be engaging

## Different kinds of requirements
- functional
  - what the system should do
- non-functional
  - run on a variety of platforms (environment)
  - delivered in 6 months (time contraints)
- data
  - what kinds of data needs to be stored?
- environment / context of use
  - physical
    - dusty? noisy? light? heat? humidity?
  - social
    - sharing of files, displays, privacy
  - organizational
    - hierarchy, IT departments, user support
  - users
    - novice: step-by-step, constained, clear information
    - expert
    - frequent short cuts
    - clear instructions / menu paths
- usability
  - learnability
  - flexibility
  - throughput

### Example
Self-service cafeteria

- functional: calculate total cost of purchases
- data: access to price of products in cafeteria
- environmental: noisy and busy environment, users may be talking while using the system
- user: majority of users under 25, comfortable dealing with technology
- usability: simple for new users, memorable for frequent users, efficient, deal easily with user errors


## Some guidelines
- focus on identifying stakeholders needs
- involve all the stakeholder groups
- involve more than one representative from each stakeholder group
- use a combination of data gathering techniques
- support process with props
- run pilot session
- carefully record data (always better to have more)

## Data interpretation and analysis
- start soon after you gather the data
- get an initial interpretation, then go for deeper analysis
- different approaches might emphasize different things
  - eg. class diagrams, ER diagrams

## Guidelines for interview questions
- avoid compound sentences
- split them into separate questioons
- avoid leading questions

## Task descriptions
- scenarios: an informal narrative story, simple, personal, not generalizable
- user cases: assume interaction with the system, detailed understanding of the interaction
- essential use cases: abstract away from the details, doesn't have the same assumptions as use cases
