# Interaction Design

## What is interaction design?
- designing interactive products to support people in their everyday working lives
- the design of spaces for human communication and interaction
- the design part of human-computer interaction

## What to design
- understand the kind of activities people are doing when interacting with your product
- take into account what people are good and bad at
- consider what might help people with the way they currently do things
- provide quality user experience
- listen to what people want and get them involved in the design
- use tried and tested user-based techniques during the design process

Steps
1. identify needs and establish requirements
2. develop alternative designs that meet the requirements
3. interactive prototypes of the designs
4. evaluate continually thoughout the process
5. always be aware of user diversity

## Usability goals
- effectiveness
- efficiency
- safety
- utility
- learnability
- memorability
- criteria
  - time to complete a task
  - time to learn a task
  - number of errors made

## User experience goals
- satisfaction
- enjoyment
- fun
- entertainment
- aesthetically pleasing
- creativity

Consider the tradeoffs between usability and user experience

## Design principles
- visibility
- feedback
- constraints
  - physical (usb cable)
  - logical (shading out deactivated menu items)
  - cultural (red for danger)
- mapping: relationship between controls and effects
- consistency (cut/paste shortcuts)
- affordance (real vs perceived): attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it (gives a clue)

## Usability principles
- visibility of system status
- match between system and real world
- user control and freedom
- consistency and standards
- help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
- error prevention
- recognition rather than recall
- flexibility and efficiency of use
- aesthetic and minimalistic design
- help and documentation

They are
- similar to design priniciples, except more prescriptive
- used mainly as the basis for evaluating systems
