# Understanding and conceptualizing interaction
- interaction design is the design of products that reveal themselves over time

## Example
Design an application to let people organize, store, and retrieve email in a fast and enjoyable way

### The 'wrong' approach
- sketch out how the interface might look
- structure system architecture
- start coding

### The interaction design approach
- ask users about current experiences
- look at existing tools
- why, what and how are you going to design the application

## Understanding the problem domain
- what do you want to create?
- what are the assumptions?
- will it achieve what you hope it will?

### Some questions to ask
- are there problems with an existing product?
- why do you think there are problems?
- why do you think your proposed ideas might be useful?
- how would you see people using it with their current way of doing things?
- how will it support people in their activities?
- will it really help them?
- are your assumptions realistic or "wish-list"?

## Conceptual models
How will users understand the system (NOT YOU!)

- a description of the proposed system in terms of a set of integrated ideas and concepts about what it should do, behave and look like, what will be understandable by the user in the manner intended

### Conceptual models based on activities
- giving instructions
  - issuing commands using keyboard, function keys, selction options via menus
- conversing
  - interacting with the system as if having a conversation
- manipulating and navigating
  - acting on objects and interacting with virtual objects
- exploring and browsing
  - finding out and learning things

#### Giving instructions
- users instruct the system and tell it what to do
- quick and efficient interaction for repetitive kinds of actions performed on multiple objects
- form of commands, syntax, and organization have been investigated

#### Conversing
- underlying model of having a conversation with another human
- ranges from simple voice recognition to more complex "natural language" dialogues
- virtual agents at the interface: clippy

#### Pros and cons of conversation model
- allows users especially novies and technophobes to interact with the system in a way that is familiar
  - makes users feel more comfortable, less scared
- misunderstandings can arise when the system doesn't know how to parse what the user says
- nobody likes to be interrogated

#### Manipulating and navigating
- dragging, selecting, opening, closing, and zooming actions on virtual objects
- WYSIWYG
- also called direct manipulation
- novices learn the basic functionality quickly
- experienced users can work extremely rapidly to carry out a wide range of tasks
- error messages rarely needed
- users receive immediate feedback
- users experience less anxiety
- gain confidence and mastery feeling in control

Disadvantages:
- some people take the metaphor of direct manipulation too literally
- not all tasks can be described by objects and not all actions can be done directly
- some tasks are better achieved through delegating
- screen space demanding
- mouse slower than pressing function keys

#### Exploring and browsing
- similar to how people browse information with existing media
- information is structured to allow flexibility in the way the user is able to explore it

## Interface metaphors
- interface designed to be similar to a physical entity but also has its own properties
- exploits user's familiar knowledge helping them to understand the unfamiliar
- conjusts up the essence of the unfamiliar activity

### Benefits of interface metaphors
- makes learning of new systems easier
- helps users understand the underlying conceptual model
- can be very innovative and enable the realm of computers an their applications to be made more accessible to a greater diversity of users

### Problems with interface metaphors
- you can break conventional and cultural rules
  - eg. where you place the recycle bin; on the desktop?
- can constrain designers in the way they conceptualize a problem space
- may conflict with design principles
- forces users to use metaphors
- what if you want to switch to a new metaphor or conceptual model?

## Interaction mode to style
Interaction mode
  - what the user is doing when interacting with a system (eg. instructing, talking, browsing, etc.)

Interaction style
- the kind of interface used to support the mode
  - eg. speech, menu-based, gesture, etc.

Some kinds of interaction styles:
- command
- speech
- data-entry
- form fill-in
- query
- graphical
- web
- pen
- augmented reality
- gesture
- etc.

### Which interaction style to choose?
- need to determine requirements and user needs
- take the budget and other constraints into account
- also will depend on suitability of technology for activity being supported

### Interaction paradigms
- another form of inspiration for conceptual models
- ubiquitous computing
- pervasive computing
- augmented reality
- transparent computing
- attentive environments
- etc.

## Knowledge
- declarative knowledge
  - stop at red lights
  - new york is a big city
- procedural knowledge
  - perform music
  - stop a car with a flat tire on icy road
  - play basketball
 - memory

## Hierarchical Task Analysis
- used to investigate an existing situation
  - not to envision new products
- physical and observable actions to achieve a goal
- tasks are subdivided into subtasks
- caveats:
  - real tasks are complex and task analysis does not scale well
  - it can not model tasks that are overlapping or in parellel
  - also can not model interruptions
