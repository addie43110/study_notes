# Social Aspects of HCI: Designing for collaboration and communication

## Conversation with others
Various mechanisms we follow to hold a conversation
- turn-taking to coordinate conversation
- back channeling to signal to continue ("uh, ummm, ahh")
- farewell rituals
- implicit and explicit cues (fidgeting with coats and bags explicitly says, "Oh, I have to go now")
- breakdowns in conversation
- "repairing" the conversation
  - Ahhh! I thought you mean that one; so it's this one then."

## Design implications
- how to support conversations when people are 'at a distance' from each other
- email, videoconferencing, instant messaging, etc...

## Synchronous computer-mediated communication
- conversations are supported in real time through voice and/or typing
- benefits
  - non-verbal communication
- problems
  - video lacks bandwidth, shadows, jitter
  - bad behavior is not accountable

## Asynchronous communication
- communication takes place remotely at different times
  - email, newsgroups, blogs
- benefits
  - read anyplace, anytime
  - easier to express things
- problems
  - spamming
  - message overload
  - lack of non-verbal cues
