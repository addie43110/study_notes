# Interfaces

## Command-based interfaces
- based on typing (usually in terminals)
- syntax enables lots of flexibility
- hard to learn and remember
- still relevant and "under the hood"
- also can be used by visually impaired users

## WIMP / GUI
- Xerox Star interface led to the birth of WIMP and GUI
  - Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointing Device
  - widgets
- later: toolbars, dialog boxes, scroll bars, cascading menus, etc.
- window management
- the return of tiled windows

## Multimedia
- combining different media within a single interface
- typically graphics, text, video, sound, animations
- the sum is better than parts
- allows for rapid access
- interactive TV services and digital encyclopedias were early multimedia examples

## Information visualization and dashboards
- computer-generated graphics of complex data that is typically interactive and dynamic

### Dashboards
- importance of layout, font selection
- screenshots of data, updated over periods of time
  - intended to be read at a glance
- more important with the rise of mobile and tablet computing
- the "home page"

## Appliances
- most common mistake is making control too complex
- at the same time, sometime more control is needed for more functionality

## Mobile
- the average person checks their phone 110 times/day (2013)
- novel interactions:
  - touch gestures
  - smule ocarina
  - iBeer

## Speech interfaces
- apple's siri
- amazon's alexa
- microsoft's ortana
- tehnologies implemented include
  - automatic speech recognition
  - text-to-speech synthesis
- real-time speech translation

## Pen
- there is a long history of pen interfaces predating WIMP
- several times we think that pen interfaces have come of age but then they face
- iPad Pro and Microsoft Surface come with sophisticated pen interfaced
- importance of pressure sensitivity and latency

## Touch
- detect presence and location of one or  more touch points
- touch gestures: swiping, flicking, pinching, pushing, and tapping

## Air-based gestures
- recognize body, arm and hand gestures in a room
- sensor-controller vs camera technology
- wii remote
- xbox kinect
- that guy who dances to make music
- the marimba slider dude

## Haptic
- digitize the sense of touch
- tactile feedback by applying vibration and forces using actuators
- ex. vibrate mode of mobile phones

## Misc
Other methos of interaction include:
- multi-modal
- shareable
- tangible
- AR and MR
- wearbles
- robots and drones
- natural user interfaces and beyond
  - user interface should be "invisible"
