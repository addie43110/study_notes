# Understanding Users

## Personas
- introduced by Allan Cooper's classic "the inmates are running the asylum"
- simple in concept, but powerful when applied with some sophistication
- develop a precise description of the user and what they wish to accomplish
- make a pretend user and design for them
- they are not real people
  - they are hypothetical archetypes of actual users
- making up personal details and names makes them feel more real
- they are defined by their goals
- they are still iterative

## Core cognitive aspects
- attention
- perception and recognition
- memory
- reading, speaking, and listening
- problem solving, planning, reasoning and decision making
- learning focus: attention, perception and recognition, memory

## Auditory display pitfalls
- too loud
  - causes startle response
- too frequent
  - causes signals to be ignored
- too many
  - signals must be distinguishable
- too vague
  - causes uncertainty, each signal must convey a special meaning

noise level (in dB) | noise
--- | ---
140 | jet aircraft start
100 | power chain saw
60 | normal conversation
30 | whisper
10 | recording studio
0 | threshold of hearing

## Memory
- involves encoding and recalling knowledge and acting appropriately
- context is important in affecting our memory
- recognition is much better than recall
  - rise of GUI over command-based interfaces


## Mental model
- users develop an understanding of a system through learning and using it
- knowledge is often described as a mental model
- people make inferences using mental models of how to carry out tasks
  - deep vs. shallow models: how to drive a car vs how a car works
- many people have incorrect mental models
  - example: valves/dials on screen more difficult to use
  - when the screen is frozen, most people bash the keys when in reality this will not help

## External cognition
- humans are great at toolmaking
- interaction with external representations
  - maps, notes, diagrams
- computers are the ultimate external cognition tool
- using diaries, calendars, notes to remind us what to do
- marking emails
- computation offloading
- annotating
- cognitive tracing

## Transparency
- useful feedback
- system and state are easy to understand and use
- clear and easy to follow instructions
- appropriate online help
- context-sensitive guidance of how to proceed when stuck
