# Understanding how interfaces affect users

## Affective aspects
- HCI has traditionally been about designing efficient and effective systems
- recently, there has been a move towards considering how to design interactive systems to make people *respond* in certain ways

## Expressive interfaces
- colours, icons, sounds, graphical elements and animations are used to make the look and feel of an interface appealing
  - conveys an emotional state
- this can affect the usability of an interface
  - people are prepared to put up with certain aspects of an interface (eg. slow downloads) if the end result is appealing and pleasing.

## Friendly interfaces
- "At home with Bob" was a friendly software
- had many metaphors based on a living room
- agents in guise of pets were included to talk to the user
- this was to make users feel at ease and comfortable
- unfortunately, "At home with Bob" was a spectacular failure

## User created expressiveness
- emoticons compensate for lack of expressiveness in text communication
  - happy :)
  - sad :(
  - cool B)
- use of icons and shorthand in text and instant messaging has emotional connotations as well

## User frustration
- many causes
  - applications don't work or crash
  - system doesn't do what users want
  - user expectations are not met
  - insufficient information to enable the user to know what to do
  - vague error messages, obtuse and/or condemning
  - appearance of interface is garish, noisy, gimmicky, or patronizing

### Error messages
- "The application has unexpectedly quit due to a type 2 error"

Shneiderman's guidelines for error messages include:
- avoid using terms like FATAL, INVALID, or BAD
- audio warnings
- avoid UPPERCASE and long code numbers
- messages should be precise rather than vague
- context-sensitive help

### Should computers say they are sorry
- Reeves and Naas argue that computers should be made to apologize
  - this emulates human etiquette
  - would users be as forgiving of computers if they said sorry like humans?
  - how sincere would they think the computer was being?

## Anthropomorphism
- attributing human-like qualities to inanimate objects
- frequently used in advertising
  - dancing butter, drinks, cereal
- much eploited in HCI to make the user experience more enjoyable, more motivating, and to reduce anxiety


### Evidence to support anthropomorphism
- Reeves and Naas found that computers that flatter and praise users in education have a positive impact on their learning
  - "Your question makes an important and useful distinction. Great job."
- students were more willing to continue exercises with this kind of feedback

### Criticism of anthropomorphism
- deceptive, makes people feel anxious, inferior or stupid
- people don't tend to like screen characters that wave their fingers at the user and say: "Now, Chris. That's not right. You can do better than that. Try again."
- many prefer the impersonal:
  - "Incorrect, try again."
- studies have shown that personalized feedback is considered to be less honest and makes the users feel less responsible for their actions.

## Virtual characters
- web characters, videogame characters, learning companions
- provide a persona that is welcoming, has personality and makes user feel involved with them

  - yamaha vocaloid singing synthesis engine
  - team of programmers "author" the performance

### Disadvantages
- lead people into a false sense of believe, enticing them to confide personal secrets with chatterbots
- annoying and frustrating (clippy)
- not trustworthy
  - virtual sales agents

### Agents
Can be classified in terms of the degree of anthropomorphism they exhibit:
  - synthetic characters
  - animated agents
  - emotional agents
  - embodied conversational agents

#### Synthetic characters
- autonomous with internal states and able to respond to externalevents (like a fake dog)

#### Animated agents
- play collaboraive role at the interface
- often cartoon-like
- flies into plants and explains things on the fly
- gives advice to students

#### Emotional agents
- predefined personality and set of emotions that the user can change

#### Embodied conversational agents
  - real human-like body
  - uses gestures, non-verbal communication
  - facial expressions, winks
  - sophisticated AI-techniques

### Which is the most believable agent?
- believability refers to the extent to which users come to believe in an agent's intention and personality
- appearance is very important
  - realism is more believable than cartoons
- behavior is very important
  - how an agent moves, gestures, and refers to objects in the screen
  - exaggeration of facial expressions and gestures to show underlying emotions
