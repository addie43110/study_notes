# Data Gathering
Data gathering is mostly used at two phases of interaction design
1. Establishing requirements
2. Evaluation

## Three techniques
- gathering quantitative and qualitative data
  - interviews
    - structured
    - unstructured
  - questionnaires
    - paper
    - online
  - observation
    - direct
    - indirect

## Five key issues
1. Setting goals: how are they specified
2. Indentifying participants
3. Relationship with participants: informed consent? Incentives?
4. Triangulation: different perspectives
5. Pilot studies

## Triangulation
1. Triangulation of data: using different data
2. Investigator triangulation: using several different investigators in the analysis process
3. Triangulation of theories: using several different theories
4. Methodological triangulation: using more than one method to gather data (such as interviews, observations, questionnaires, and documents)

## Data recording
1. Notes
2. Photographs
3. Audio
4. Audio + photographs
5. Video
6. Screen capturing
7. ontroller capturing
8. Logging
9. Sensor data

## Interviews
- open-ended
- structured
- semi-structured
- group interviews
- one way interviews

## Working with children
- children think and react to situations differently from adults

## What they sav vs. what they do
- users tend to say what they think they should say rather than what they actually do
- triangulation can help

## Questionnaires
- questions need to be clearly worded and the data collected analyzed efficiently
- how are they different/similar to structured interviews?
- things to think about: ordering of questions, different versions of questionnaires for different populations, clear instructions, typography

### Question and response format
- check boxes
- ranges
- rating scales
- semantic differential scales
- how many questions?
- discrete or continuous?
- order of questions?

### Administering questionnaires
- get a good sample!
- need reasonable response rate
- do people answer online questionnaires differently to paper and pencil?

## Observation
- useful in any stage during development
- observed:
  - directly by investigator
  - indirectly through records of activity
- place:
  - in the field
  - in a controlled environment

### Direct observation in the field
- difficult for people to explain what they do or even describe how they achieve a task
  - direct observation can help
- goals important but also ability to respond to changing circumstances
- degree of participation
