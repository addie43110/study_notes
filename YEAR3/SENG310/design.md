# Design, Prototyping, and Construction

## Prototyping and Construction

### What is a prototype?
- in other design fields, a prototype is a small scale model like a miniature car, building, etc.
- in HCI it can be
  - a series of screen sketches
  - a storyboard
  - slideshow
  - video
  - lump of wood (Palm Pilot)
  - cardboard mock-up
  - piece of actual software with limited functionality

### Why prototype?
- for evaluation and feedback
- for stakeholders to see the actual product
- test ideas for yourself
- answers questions and supports designed in choosing between alternatives

### What to prototype?
- technical issues
- work flow, task design
- screen layouts and information display
- difficult, controversial, or critical areas

### Low fidelity prototyping
- uses a medium that is unlike the final medium
- is quick, cheap and easily changed
- examples:
  - sketches of screens, task sequences
  - post-it notes
  - story boards
  - Wizard of Oz

### The Palm Pilot story
- less is more
- the "Apple Newton" had a ton of features, was powerful but was a failure
- Jeff Hawkins (founder of the Palm Pilot) walked around with a block of wood in his pocket
  - concentrated on usability and essential functionality
  - every pixel counts
  - no save button - 1 application at a time

### Storyboards + sketching
Storyboards
  - often used with scenarios
  - bring more detail
  - chance to role-play
  - a series of sketches showing how a user might progress through a task
  - used early in design

Sketching
  - important to low fidelity prototyping

Index cards
  - often used for webdev
  - each card represents one screen

### Wizard of Oz prototyping
- user thinks they are interacting with a computer
- a developer is actually responding to the input rather than the system
- usually done early in design to understand user expectations


### High-fidelity prototyping
- uses materials you would expect to be in the final product
- looks more like the final system
- danger is that users may think they have the full system

### Vertical vs horitzonal prototyping
- vertical: a lot of detail for only a few functions
- horizontal: wide range of function but with little detail

### Construction
- taking the prototypes and creating a whole
- from design to implementation
- quality must be attended to: usability, reliability, robustness, maintenability, integrity portability, efficiency

## Conceptual design
- transform user needs/requirements into a conceptual model
- don't move to a solution too quickly: iterate
- consider alternatives, prototyping helps

### Three perspectives
- Interaction mode
  - activity-based: instructing, conversing, manipulating and navigating, exploring and browsing
  - object-based: structured around real world objects
- Interaction paradigm
  - desktop paradigm
  - ubiquitous computing
  - wearable computing
  - mobile devices
- suitable metaphor
  - interface metaphors
  - understand functionality, identify potential problem areas, generate metaphors
  - evaluate metaphors:
    - how much structure does it provide?
    - how is it relevant to the problem
    - is it easy to represent?
    - will the audience understand it?
    - how extensible is it?

## Physical design
- interaction between conceptual and physical design
  - different kinds of widgets
  - menu design
  - icon design
  - screen display
  - information display

### Screen design
- splitting functions across screens
- frustration if too many simple screens
- draw attention to point (color, motion, boxing)
- animation can be distracting
- grouping, physical proximity


### Successes of UI tools
- Window managers and toolkits
- event languages
- visual basic
- python, perl
- hypertext
- object-oriented programming

### Failures of UI tools
- user interface management tools
- constraints

## Why design can fail
- designers are not typical users
- too much emphasis on aesthetics
- designer's clients are not users
- complexity of design process
- designing for special people
- two temptations:
  - creeping featurism (adding more features than necessary)
  - worshipping of false images instead of explorable systems
    - appearance of technical sophistication "nerd" factor
