# Introduction

## What is a database?
A database (DB) is a collection of information that exists over a long period of time. A Database Management System (DBMS) is software for handling large data **efficiently** and **safely**.

## What does a DBMS do?
- allow users to create databases
- specify schemas
- query and modify data using a high level language
- intelligent storage of large amounts of data
  - protect data from misuse
  - efficient access
- concurrency
- recovery from failures and crashes

Databases evolved from file systems, with the addition of a query language.
- without a query language, we need to
  - open file
  - scan data
  - parse data
  - etc.

## Relational databases
- organized by tables (also called relations)
- behind-the-scenes algorithms take care of efficiency
- queries in high-lebel language
